The model I trained "f1_model1" can forecast the final result of a race by feeding in couple of laps of a race.
For instance, you can feed first 10 laps of Suzuka track into the model and check the prediction of the final result.
Of course this is just a ML model that is trained on a very limited data and it is by no means 100% accurate. 
No previous result garantee futrure results. Race conditions, new drivers, etc. can completely affect the model's results. 

First open the ml.py file and run it. 
After it is done, you will have a final_data_2025.csv file in your directory.
Open the model.ipynb file. 
Run the whole file. You will see the forcast in a table.
You can also change the race name and number of laps that the model allows to see in test_part_df variable.

This repository will be updated depending on the free time I have.
